## Description

A fast paced platformer. Tire the other dancing peacocks by repeating their dance.

The flashing lights and snazzy fashion of the Discotheque scene were as natural for this peacock as the feathers on their tails. When everyone wants a piece of you, you got to dance your way to survival!
